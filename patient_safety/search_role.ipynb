The doctor had prescribed 10mg instead of 100mg and the drug chart indicates that this was given on the morning and evening of 05/12/18 and the morning of 06/12/18.

She then rang me back to explain that the patient had lost the use of an arm during the admission so needed a nomad to enable him to take his medication. In the light of this new information I agreed that a nomad was appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient came into see me on Monday 1st July and brought the nomads supplied from QA. These contained dapsone, dolutegravir and azithromyxin but not symtuza. There was a label attached to the nomad with the symtuza details which included <<patients own medication relabelled. Product not in nomad>>. Both the patient and his mother said that it had not been explained that some tablets were not in the nomad and said that a separate bottle had not been provided. Therefore he had not taken the symtuza for a week which is concerning as this is his main HIV medication containing 4 drugs in 1 tablet. \\r\\n\\r\\nI appreciate that there are stability problems with symtuza in a nomad, but if a patient has been assessed as unable to open bottles because if his arm problem, how is it expected that he will take his medication? I also do not understand why the pharmacist did not ring me back again once this was decided.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor our patients who need devices to take their medication, we do include symtuza in the device on a risl/benefit basis, as we know that if they don't take it we will not be controlling their HIV. By monitoring viral load we can pick up issues with compliance or possible instability from the medication, if they assure us that they do take their medication. The only other option is to switch symtuza to multiple other tablets and many patients prefer to take 1 tablet (and some find multiple tablets a disincentive to take them).\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately, I had ordered dosettes ready for this patient (containing symtuza, dapsone, dolutegravir and azithromycin) so was able to provide these to the patient on Monday.He was happy for me to take the nomads prepared by yourselves to avoid confusion.  \"\n",

The surgeon requested Co-amoxiclav after the patient was anaesthetized, and this was drawn up by the ODP . Dr started to administer the antibiotic as requested but almost immediately (after approx. 2ml of 1.2g co-amoxiclav in 20ml water) we realised that although we had confirmed some non-medication related allergies, we had not in fact confirmed any specific drug allergies in the patient and so we stopped and checked the drug chart. It transpired she had penicillin listed on her drug allergies (a component of co-amoxiclav) with the reaction stated as \"blackouts\". Having identified this and communicated it to the team it was decided to give her teicoplanin instead (2nd line treatment).\\r\\n\\r\\nNo adverse reaction or physiological response was noted after the administration of this small amount of drug and after the operation the consultant anaesthetist informed the patient of what had occurred, and apologized for the error as a duty of candour. The patient explained that she had received penicillin before on numerous occasions but it had made her feel faint. She was happy that no harm had resulted and was otherwise happy with the anaesthesia care she had received and thanked Dr  for that.\\r\\n'\n",

I was working with my military colleague looking after team 2 on ward C6. We had two patients admitted in a short period of time which we were not given prior warning of. My military colleague took the handover for one patient and he was placed in a side room. The other patient appeared in a bed space in a bay of 4 patients with no handover received by my colleague or the nurse in charge. We had no medical notes for him and he had not been clerked. He was accompanied his daughter and her baby and he slept throughout my time on the shift. We discovered that he was an outpatient under Gastroenterlogy team who are situated in the ward next door to C6. I approached the doctors in this team on more than one occasion for information about him but they were busy and it took time for him to be clerked. My military colleague took his observations on admission which were satisfactory. The patient asked my colleague for pain relief at around 5pm-5.30pm at which time the doctor produced the drug chart and insulin chart as this patient was diabetic. I took his blood sugar when I received the chart and it read as >27.8. I informed the doctor and proceeded to try and find a Ketones machine. This proved very difficult as C6, C5 and C7 do not have a machine. I went to D1 where I knew there would a machine and brought it back to the ward. Unfortunately it did not work despite myself and my colleague using valuable time trying and carrying out the control test. The nurse in charge told me to try D2 ward instead. I retrieved a machine from D2 after returning the other machine to D1 but the ward requested it back immediately. Thankfully this machine did work and his Ketone reading was 3.9. I then had to return the machine to D2 after informing the doctor of the ketone level. The doctor took blood cultures from the patient and wrote up a sliding scale for the patient to be administered urgently. I did not receive this until around 19.30 whilst I was still trying to administer the IV's for the rest of my patients. \\r\\nThe 1 litre bag of saline I required for his sliding scale was not available on our ward or neighbouring wards.

KD MSO\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPatient was originally admitted with a CAP, and triaged to Respiratory. During her stay on AMU, it was identified that the patient was in DKA. During the morning the DKA was resolved and the patient needed to go on to a sliding scale (GIK). I was aware that her next VBG was due at 10:30. I spoke to the day 2 SHO on the ward, about the VBG and that I needed more saline prescribed. The saline was prescribed on the fluid chart, but had not been signed. Due to needing calcification of the patient’s patients potassium levels. I was told by the day 2 drs on the ward to bleep Adam, which I did and explained the situation to him. He said that he would be in to see the patient soon. The patient was reviewed at 11:15, and he requested bloods and an VBG. I explained to him that the AMTs would be unable to do the bloods as she was on her own. These bloods were eventually done at 14:15. As I was going on my break, I explained to Adam that as per diabetic nurse plan, C needed to swapped to the GIK and that as both the  saline and dextrose had finished, I would turn the insulin off – due to the patient feeling that her blood sugars were dropping and she had started to feel unwell. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I returned from my break (15:15), the nurse was working with told me that that the GIK has not been prescribed. When I asked the Respiratory doctor, he said that one of the day 2 doctors was going to prescribe it, I told him that it had not been prescribed and that I needs doing. To allow prompt prescribing, I gave the Respiratory doctor the correct GIK protocol chart for patients who weigh over. 50kg (patient weighs 73kg). However, while prescribing the GIK an error was made and I asked him to re-prescribe it, which he started to do, but used the protocol for patients who weigh less than 50kg. I spotted this and gave him the correct protocol. The respiratory doctor appeared to be unsure how to prescribe it. I had to suggest that she went on an individualised rate as the patient normally runs high (10-12) which is outside the normal target range on a GIK. Also on the GIK protocol, 10% dextrose with 20mmols of potassium was circled, but only 10% dextrose was prescribed. Once everything has been correctly prescribed – around 16:30 I attempted to start the GIK, despite the patient’s cannula flushing and being pain free on flushing, when the saline IV had been started, the patient was complaining on pain from the cannula. I asked one of the ward doctors to have a look as I knew that the respiratory doctor was busy and needed to see other patients. She had to go the 16:30 meeting then on her return she would attempt to re cannulate the patient. At 17:10 the dr told me that she was unable to and that we should attempt to use the cannula.

This had been signed by the dispenser and signed as 'checked by'.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were only 28 tablets in the box and it seemed very unlikely that Mr M. should be given 30 tablets to take at one time; I suggested that the 30 likely referred to the milligrams to take i.e. 6 x 5mg tablets and with Mr M. permission rang the QA pharmacy to establish this. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pharmacist advised that she was pretty certain that this should be 30mg & not to take 30 tablets as per instruction but could not fully confirm this as A & E had dispensed the tablets not the pharmacy. \\r\\n\\r\\nI rang A & E and a call was put out to the ward sister, however after being put on hold a number of times I was advised that A & E was very busy with a 9 hour wait and it was unlikely that the ward sister could speak with me now.\\r\\nFollowing discussion with Mr & Mrs M. who also thought that the 30 noted on the box referred to mg's not amount to take, Mr M. stated that he wanted to take them as he didn’t want to end up back in hospital. Mr M. has capacity to make such decisions.\\r\\nAs requested & following reading the leaflet I gave Mr M. 6 x 5mg of Prednisolone and added mg's next to the 30 on the box to prevent and minimise risk of him being given the incorrect dose by carers visiting tomorrow am.\\r\\n\\r\\nI advised Mrs M. to speak with the GP on Monday to confirm dosage which Mrs M. said she would do.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to know how Mr M. left hospital with medication labelled with an incorrect dosage that had been signed by the dispenser and counter signed as 'checked'. \\r\\nI feel that this is a near miss incident that could have had lead to Mr M. overdosing if the carer had not questioned this. \\r\\n\\r\\nCan this please be investigated and could you get back to me with an explanation as to how this happened and any measures that will be put in place to minimise risk of this happening again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\nA.C. - Sheltered Housing Manager / Registered Manager\\r\\n\"\n",

She consulted the GP prescribing lead who said it was reasonable to treat as amber recommended. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis situation became more complicated because following her DC cardioversion on 5/2/19; digoxin was stopped according to a letter received by us on 28th February. The patient then saw the cardiologist on 9th May who suggested she start amiodarone and requested us to prescribe it. Initially it seemed a simpler case of starting her on amiodarone and monitoring appropriately however in this letter it says \"thank you for restarting the digoxin\", we have no clinic letter asking that this takes place between February and May and neither was the patient aware of this and so when her box finished on Saturday 18th May she subsequently has not been taking digoxin. \\r\\n\\r\\nKnowing this information we made her an appropriate management plan starting 24/5/19 \\r\\n \\r\\n1.Restart Digoxin for minimum 1 week\\r\\n2.Check baseline Digoxin levels and Liver Function Test (outstanding amiodarone baseline monitoring not undertaken recently) w/c 3/6/19 \\r\\n3.Start amiodarone at loading dose: One Three Times A Day for 1 week. \\r\\n4.Once loading complete; start maintenance dose of amiodarone 200mg once a day \\r\\n5.After one week of maintenance dose; check Digoxin level w/c 17/6/19 ; Dr to consider dose adjustments to digoxin \\r\\n6.After 4 week amiodarone therapy - check Digoxin level w/c 1/7/19; Dr to consider dose adjustments to digoxin \\r\\n7.Continue maintenance therapy and check bloods for U&E, LFT, TFT every 6 months \\r\\n\\r\\nBaseline amiodarone monitoring was a concern but on checking ICE it was apparent TFT and U&E were checked Jan\\'19, her last chest x-ray was on Oct \\'18 and ECG, she advises me was done on 9/5/19 at cardiology.

The patient was seen in clinic on 17th May be Dr ND to ask her to initiate therapy but unfortunately we are prohibited from phenoxybenzamine initiation due to formulary guidance - it is an \\'amber\\' drug and clearly states that it must be initiated in secondary care and only prescribed in primary care once patient has been monitored and stabilised.  My colleague contacted the endocrinology department several times on the 17th May and was told that no clinicians were available to rectify the issue - there was reportedly a registrar in the building but he did no respond to several bleep requests from myself or the pharmacy department over the course of the day.  Unfortunately we found ourselves with no other alternative but to ask the patient to present at A&E for assessment and phenoxybenzamine prescribing.  I sent the patient along with a letter to explain our position and ask that the message be relayed back to Endocrinology.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatient was seen by Endocrinology in OPD on 5th June 2019 and it was noted in correspondence from Dr S that the patient needed to further titrate up the phenoxybenzamine, i.e. it was not stabilised (and only a short term treatment until she received surgery).  We then received another letter from Dr Meeking on the 13th June (dated 11th June) asking us to prescribe phenoxybenzamine, stating it was \\'yellow\\' on formulary, until the patient scheduled surgery on 21st June.  The patient was seen in clinic by Dr Devall to discuss this letter and reported that she had been told she \\'had to have the medication otherwise she could die on the operating table\\'.

It is unlicensed in the UK, and has to be specially imported at great expense to the NHS from Germany. It should clearly be prescribed, supplied and monitored by a Secondary Care Specialist only, and not by GPs.\\r\\n\\r\\nGPs have written to the Consultant Neurologist, Dr Sean Slaght, at QAH, explaining that they really don\\'t have the experience to be taking clinical responsibility for such a strange and unusual drug, and that they strongly feel that it should be prescribed by Specialists. The Neurologist has replied in a letter to GPs in December 2018, how important it is for patient to continue to receive this medication, and that \"any interruption in the supply of Ospolot is a risk\" and \"will cause him to have a massive increase in seizures and will increase his risk of death\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe GPs feel that this is clearly forcing them to continue prescribing this drug for the time being - Dr Slaght stated in Dec 2018 that he would try to find a way for this to be prescribed and supplied through Secondary Care, but there has been no further response from him since then. The GPs feel that Secondary Care are burying their heads and hoping this will go away, and that the GPs will forget to chase this up!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clinical evidence clearly points to the fact that this is NOT an appropriate drug for GPs to be asked to prescribe, and that clinical responsibility for prescribing, supplying and monitoring should rest with Secondary Care Specialists - but so far they seem unwilling to take the responsibility and are expecting GP to prescribe, which they do not feel comfortable with.\"'\n",

KD MSO\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPatient was originally admitted with a CAP, and triaged to Respiratory. During her stay on AMU, it was identified that the patient was in DKA. During the morning the DKA was resolved and the patient needed to go on to a sliding scale (GIK). I was aware that her next VBG was due at 10:30. I spoke to the day 2 SHO on the ward, about the VBG and that I needed more saline prescribed. The saline was prescribed on the fluid chart, but had not been signed. Due to needing calcification of the patient’s patients potassium levels. I was told by the day 2 drs on the ward to bleep Adam, which I did and explained the situation to him. He said that he would be in to see the patient soon. The patient was reviewed at 11:15, and he requested bloods and an VBG. I explained to him that the AMTs would be unable to do the bloods as she was on her own. These bloods were eventually done at 14:15. As I was going on my break, I explained to Adam that as per diabetic nurse plan, C needed to swapped to the GIK and that as both the  saline and dextrose had finished, I would turn the insulin off – due to the patient feeling that her blood sugars were dropping and she had started to feel unwell. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I returned from my break (15:15), the nurse was working with told me that that the GIK has not been prescribed. When I asked the Respiratory doctor, he said that one of the day 2 doctors was going to prescribe it, I told him that it had not been prescribed and that I needs doing. To allow prompt prescribing, I gave the Respiratory doctor the correct GIK protocol chart for patients who weigh over. 50kg (patient weighs 73kg). However, while prescribing the GIK an error was made and I asked him to re-prescribe it, which he started to do, but used the protocol for patients who weigh less than 50kg. I spotted this and gave him the correct protocol. The respiratory doctor appeared to be unsure how to prescribe it. I had to suggest that she went on an individualised rate as the patient normally runs high (10-12) which is outside the normal target range on a GIK. Also on the GIK protocol, 10% dextrose with 20mmols of potassium was circled, but only 10% dextrose was prescribed. Once everything has been correctly prescribed – around 16:30 I attempted to start the GIK, despite the patient’s cannula flushing and being pain free on flushing, when the saline IV had been started, the patient was complaining on pain from the cannula. I asked one of the ward doctors to have a look as I knew that the respiratory doctor was busy and needed to see other patients. She had to go the 16:30 meeting then on her return she would attempt to re cannulate the patient. At 17:10 the dr told me that she was unable to and that we should attempt to use the cannula. The GIK was started eventually at 17:15 – 3 hours after the DKA infusions had finished. '\n",

The patient was seen in clinic on 17th May be Dr ND to ask her to initiate therapy but unfortunately we are prohibited from phenoxybenzamine initiation due to formulary guidance - it is an \\'amber\\' drug and clearly states that it must be initiated in secondary care and only prescribed in primary care once patient has been monitored and stabilised.  My colleague contacted the endocrinology department several times on the 17th May and was told that no clinicians were available to rectify the issue - there was reportedly a registrar in the building but he did no respond to several bleep requests from myself or the pharmacy department over the course of the day.  Unfortunately we found ourselves with no other alternative but to ask the patient to present at A&E for assessment and phenoxybenzamine prescribing.

We then received another letter from Dr Meeking on the 13th June (dated 11th June) asking us to prescribe phenoxybenzamine, stating it was \\'yellow\\' on formulary, until the patient scheduled surgery on 21st June.  The patient was seen in clinic by Dr Devall to discuss this letter and reported that she had been told she \\'had to have the medication otherwise she could die on the operating table\\'.
